/**

 * already decided "signed out" (a single `/account_menu` that threw
 * because the network wasn't up yet) had no path back short of an app
 * restart. Dropping the 5-minute auth-context cache and invalidating
 * the auth triad turns each successful refresh into a fresh verdict.
 *
 * Cheap in the common case: three queries, only refetched where
 * they're actually mounted.
 *
 * The exception is a session that was DEAD when the app opened. The
 * keeper renews it ~26 s into the launch, but by then every content
 * query has already run against a jar Google no longer honors and
 * cached what came back: an anonymous `/browse` answers 200 with an
 * empty shelf, so the emptiness is stored as success data, not as an
 * error. Refreshing only the auth triad then repaints the account (the
 * sign-in button disappears) over a library that stays empty for the
 * rest of the session, which is exactly the "it says I'm logged in but
 * nothing loads" report. `["liked-songs"]` is worse still: 1 h
 * staleTime plus `shouldPersistQuery`, so the empty list survives a
 * reload from disk and the hearts stay grey.
 *
 * So when the frontend currently believes it is signed out, treat the
 * refresh as a sign-in and invalidate everything. Gated on that belief
 * because the event also fires every 20 min on a perfectly healthy
 * session, where a blanket invalidation would refetch the whole app
 * for nothing.
